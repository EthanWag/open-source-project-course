# Final reflection

The final deliverable for this course has two parts: (1) A written report, and (2) and oral presentation. We hope that after the course you will continue working on the project and especially that you will maintain the relationships you have developed. You are welcome to use AI tools to help you with your writing, if you find those useful.

## Written submission

Please submit a (maximum) two page report summarizing you contributions to an open source project.  Your report is to have the following sections:

* Summary
* Describe the project, and why you chose the project
* For each of your contributions (possibly grouped in some way) describe
    * The contribution and why it is meaningful to the project
    * The engineering work involved, including a link to the contribution itself (pull requests, commits, etc.)
    * The process of contributing (and the current status of the contribution)
* Reflect on what you've learned through your involvement in the open source project

## Oral presentation

This will serve the role of a "final exam" for the course and the presentations will take place during finals week. In explaining your contributions, please assume your audience is *not* familiar with project. The content of the presentation should be similar to the written report, but note that you will only have 5 minutes to present.
