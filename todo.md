Creative

* [1st-draft] README.md - breakdown into an overview and two weeks worth of material (it is all in the README atm)

Collaborative

* [early-draft] README.md - needs to be broken down (overview and two weeks) + practicing section needs lots of work

Capable

* [1st-draft] README.md - missing overview of the "evaluate" learning outcome (it is mostly just analytical thinking currently)
* [not-started] evaluating-work.md (relates to new "evaluate" learning outcome)
* [1st-draft] bug-reports.md - practicing section needs refining (and could switch to ruby)
* [early-draft] debugging.md - many missing details including practicing example
