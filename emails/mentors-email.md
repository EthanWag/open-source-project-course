Hi,
You responded to our earlier announcement about the new Open Source Projects course and expressed interest in possibly being a mentor or participating in other ways.  As we approach the beginning of the semester, we are trying to finalize our plans in this regard.

For mentors, we are looking for people that can contribute up to 30 minutes a week to meet with their mentee.  The idea is that you would provide guidance, share experiences, provide feedback to the students on their work, and point them in the right direction to solve problems when needed. It is primarily the responsibility of the students to reach out for assistance.  You can read all the details of what we are looking for here: https://github.com/jonathansillito/open-source-project-course/tree/main/mentoring

If you are interested in the details of the course, it is all on Github.  You can start at the top level course introduction (https://github.com/jonathansillito/open-source-project-course) and poke around to learn more.

If you are interested in helping, either as a mentor or in some other way, we created a survey to help us understand and record your level of interest.  Please fill it out here:

Thanks for all the discussion we have already had and your willingness to help us out.
