Hi,

This Fall Semester, Jonathan Sillito and I are piloting a new course for the CS department that focuses on the skills and tools for selecting, joining, and contributing to Open Source projects and software projects in general.  It is currently listed as CS 301R, section 001 for Fall 2025.

The goals of the course are three-fold: developing important software engineering skills, making contributions that can improve your resume or portfolio, and (possibly most importantly) connecting professionally with people outside of the university.

The main project work in the course will involve making a contribution to an open source project of your choosing.  Throughout the semester we will discuss ideas, tools, techniques, and practices that will help you reach the goal of a successful contribution.  Some topics we will cover include:

 * Identifying and understanding types of open source licenses
 * How to explore and learn a new code base/tool/library
 * Applying creativity and analytical thinking to solve software engineering problems
 * Effective communication (good bug reports/feature requests, documentation, getting involved in the project community, etc.)
 * Mentoring - finding a mentor, developing the mentoring relationship

Most of the course time will be devoted to you working on your project.  Since you are choosing the project to contribute to, you will also have the opportunity to improve your technical depth in an area of interest to you (possibly in an area not well covered by our curriculum).  We hope this course will help you stand out, find a job, but also to thrive in the workplace.

If this sounds like something you'd be interested in, we'd love to have you register for the class this coming semester.  The class is currently limited to 20 students, so sign up sooner rather than later to make sure you get in.

\- Dr. Stephens
