# Open source Project Course

The project work in this class will involve contributing to an open source project. The goal is to help you build your resume (or even better your portfolio), connect professionally and to develop important software engineering skills. 

You get to choose the project you will contribute to, improving your technical depth in an area of interest to you (possibly in an area not well covered by our curriculum). We hope this course will help you stand out, find a job, but also to thrive in the work place.

## Learning outcomes

This is a **preliminary** list motivated by the mission of the software engineering emphasis: *"We develop Christlike leaders in software engineering who bless others by being creative, collaborative, capable and curious."*

1. Example of a believer in professional contexts, including in remote interaction
2. Seek inspiration in work and life
3. Clearly define & generate (possible) solutions to engineering problems
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of creative solutions based on context & constraints
5. Learn & apply tools & techniques for understanding of existing code base
6. Learn how to develop expertise in new technology independently (openness and curiosity)
7. Effectively use appropriate (project specific) collaboration tools (VCSs, PRs, ...)
8. Communicate about technical topics, design rationale, while being open to input (humility and confidence)
9. Debug, troubleshoot & fix challenging technical problems (analytic thinking)
10. Contribute changes, meeting (non-)functional requirements (seeing them through)

And as a reminder *"A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."*

## Topics to cover

1. Criteria for selecting a project; licensing; open source manifesto; history of open source
2. Project management, processes (governance), understanding collaboration in their project and generally 
4. Build and run
3. Code archeology (tooling, practices), up and running

* Writing good bug reports
* Code reviews (both directions)
* Learning how to learn (and loving it!)
* Writing effective documentation (articulating design decisions)
* Mentoring; compile a list and have students reach out

Formula for major topics (learning outcomes)

1. Reading (of substance)
2. Class discussion
3. In class practice with feedback (looping)
4. Plan and apply in OSS project
5. Reflection

## Project steps

Your ability to contribute to an open source project, will be influenced by how well you connect with people in the project, and how well you understand the culture and processes followed by the team. Note that there are many ways to contribute beyond changes to the core systems. There are support systems, documentation, bug triage and reporting, answering questions, ...

1. Select a project to contribute to. [End of week 2]
2. Learn the relevant processes for participating in the project, join the appropriate mailing lists, discussion forums, etc. (communication continues for rest of semester and beyond)
3. Download the code, build it, run it
4. Learn relevant technologies (language, frameworks, ...)
5. Explore and understand code and tools
6. Identify ways to contribute, and begin ...
    1. Communicate plans
    2. Work on contribution
    3. Submit pull request 
    4. Respond to feedback
    5. Complete contribution

Naturally only so much can happen in our semester, however we hope that you enjoy the project sufficiently to continue your participation even after the course is complete.

## Project selection

Here are some criteria to consider while selecting a project.

* Your personal level of interest
* Activity level (i.e., avoid a "dead" project)
* Has contribution opportunities that are tractable for newcomers (check for open issues, bug reports, ...)

Some examples to consider

* [Home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/)
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/contribute/)
