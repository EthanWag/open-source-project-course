# Open source Project Course

The project work in this class will involve contributing to an open source project. The goal is to help you build your resume (or even better your portfolio), connect professionally and to develop important software engineering skills. 

You get to choose the project you will contribute to, improving your technical depth in an area of interest to you (possibly in an area not well covered by our curriculum). We hope this course will help you stand out, find a job, but also to thrive in the work place.

## Learning outcomes

This is a **preliminary** list motivated by the mission of the software engineering emphasis: *"We develop Christlike leaders in software engineering who bless others by being creative, collaborative, capable and curious."*

1. Example of a believer in professional contexts, including in remote interaction
2. Seek inspiration in work and life
3. Clearly define & generate (possible) solutions to engineering problems
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of creative solutions based on context & constraints
5. Learn & apply tools & techniques for understanding of existing code base
6. Learn how to develop expertise in new technology independently (openness and curiosity)
7. Effectively use appropriate (project specific) collaboration tools (VCSs, PRs, ...)
8. Communicate about technical topics, design rationale, while being open to input (humility and confidence)
9. Debug, troubleshoot & fix challenging technical problems (analytic thinking)
10. Contribute changes, meeting (non-)functional requirements (seeing them through)

And as a reminder *"A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."*

## Course structure

Each week of the course will be focused on one main topic, related to one or more of the course learning outcomes. A typical week will look something like the following (beginning on **Tuesday** and then spilling into **Thursday**).

1. **Reading:** Each week students will be assigned some reading of substance. We expect that students who do the reading *in advance* will get far more out of the class.

2. **Discussing:** Class will begin with a discussion of the topic, in part based on the reading. We hope students will come prepared to ask questions and contribute to the discussion.

3. **Practicing:** Students will then break into small groups to practice skills related to the topic. This practice time will be highly interactive, with interruptions for class discussion and feedback from instructors.

4. **Applying:** Students will independently apply what is learned in their open source project to deepen their understanding of the topic and contribute to the project.

5. **Reflecting:** At the end of the week students will submit a reflection on the topic based on some assigned questions. There is no "right answer" here, but you will be graded on how insightful your answers are and the depth of understanding displayed.

## Generative AI Policy

You are encouraged to make use of the various generative AI tools that can help. Please consider two things:

1. Your use of code generation tools, needs to be consistent with the rules and culture of the OSS project you are participating in. 
2. As an engineer you remain responsible for the code you produce. You need to ensure it meets the quality standards of the project (is readable, follows style guides, is well designed, defect free, etc.).

## Course topics

1. Criteria for selecting a project; licensing; open source manifesto; history of open source
2. Project management, processes (governance), understanding collaboration in their project and generally 
3. [Tools and techniques for investigating code](modules/code-archeology.md)
4. [Analytical thinking in software engineering](modules/analytical-thinking.md), including [writing bug reports](modules/bug-reports.md) and [debugging](modules/debugging.md)

* Learning how to learn (and loving it!)
* Code reviews (both directions)
* Writing effective documentation (articulating design decisions)
* Mentoring; compile a list and have students reach out


## Project steps

Your ability to contribute to an open source project, will be influenced by how well you connect with people in the project, and how well you understand the culture and processes followed by the team. Note that there are many ways to contribute beyond changes to the core systems. There are support systems, documentation, bug triage and reporting, answering questions, ...

1. Select a project to contribute to. [End of week 2]
2. Learn the relevant processes for participating in the project, join the appropriate mailing lists, discussion forums, etc. (communication continues for rest of semester and beyond)
3. Download the code, build it, run it
4. Learn relevant technologies (language, frameworks, ...)
5. Explore and understand code and tools
6. Identify ways to contribute, and begin ...
    1. Communicate plans
    2. Work on contribution
    3. Submit pull request 
    4. Respond to feedback
    5. Complete contribution

Naturally only so much can happen in our semester, however we hope that you enjoy the project sufficiently to continue your participation even after the course is complete.

## Project selection

Here are some criteria to consider while selecting a project.

* Your personal level of interest
* Activity level (i.e., avoid a "dead" project)
* Has contribution opportunities that are tractable for newcomers (check for open issues, bug reports, ...)

Some examples to consider

* [Home assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/)
* [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/developers/contribute/)
