# Open source Project Course

The goals of this course are to help students develop a better resume (or even better portfolio of work), connect professionally and develop important software engineering skills. Each student will choose an open source project to contribute to, improving their technical depth in an area of interest to them. We hope this course will help students stand out, find a job, and thrive in the work place.

* Advanced engineering principles, techniques and tools.

## Learning outcomes

This is a **preliminary** list motivated by the mission of the software engineering emphasis: *"We develop Christlike leaders in software engineering who bless others by being creative, collaborative, capable and curious."*

1. Example of a believer in professional contexts, including in remote interaction
2. Seek inspiration in work and life
3. Clearly define & generate (possible) solutions to engineering problems
4. Evaluate the effectiveness of creative solutions based on context & constraints
5. Learn & apply tools & techniques for understanding of existing code
6. Learn how to develop expertise in new technology independently (openness and curiosity)
7. Effectively use appropriate (project specific) collaboration tools (VCSs, PRs, ...)
8. Communicate about technical topics, design rationale, while being open to input (humility and confidence)
9. Debug, troubleshoot & fix challenging technical problems (analytic thinking)
10. Contribute changes, meeting (non-)functional requirements (seeing them through)

And as a reminder *"A BYU education should be (1) spiritually strengthening, (2) intellectually enlarging, and (3) character building, leading to (4) lifelong learning and service."*

## Course structure

Each full week of the course will be focused on one main topic, related to one or more of the course learning outcomes. Outside of class time student work in the course will primarily involve contributing to an open source project of their choice. The open source project is how students *apply* what is discussed and practiced during class time. A typical week will look something like the following (beginning on **Tuesday** and then spilling into **Thursday**).

1. **Reading:** Each week students will be assigned some reading of substance. We expect that students who do the reading *in advance* will get far more out of the class.

2. **Discussing:** Class will begin with a discussion of the topic, in part based on the reading. We hope students will come prepared to ask questions and contribute to the discussion.

3. **Practicing:** Next, students will break into small groups to practice skills related to the topic. Practice will be highly interactive, with interruptions for class *discussion* and *feedback*.

4. **Applying:** Students will independently apply what is learned in an open source project to deepen their understanding of the topic and to contribute to the project.

5. **Reflecting:** At the end of the week students will submit a reflection on the topic based on some assigned questions. There is no "right answer" here, but reflections will be graded on the depth of insights and understanding displayed.

Throughout the course we will use project X as a running example. Together we will discussion topics, practice skills, and explore tooling in the often in the context of project X. Independently you will apply the same ideas on an open source project of your choice.

TODO: What should X be? Kan? Home Assistant? My choice?

## Open source project work

The course schedule is designed to move you through the process of finding, joining and contributing to an open source project. We hope that the course topics will give you the skills and confidence you need, so don't stress out if you do not feel ready to contribute. The steps to contribute will look roughly like the following. However, for particular projects and particular students a different approach than suggested above may well be more effective. Feel free to adapt this schedule as appropriate.

1. Select a project
2. Technical learning (upfront and throughout)
    * Programming languages and relevant frameworks
    * Source code and build tools, including key abstractions and design rationale
3. Process learning (upfront and throughout)
    * Collaboration tools
    * Processes and culture
4. Participate socially
    * Join discussions
    * Report and triage bugs
5. Engineering work
    * Identify possible contribution based on project goals
    * Develop and socialize the contribution
6. Contribute
    * Submit pull request (or similar)
    * Work through review process
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 as possible

Your ability to contribute to an open source project, will be influenced by how well you connect with people in the project, and how well you understand the culture and follow the processes used by the team. Over time your ability to contribute will be enhanced as you further develop your reputation and relationships.

There are many ways to contribute beyond changes to the core systems. There are support systems, documentation, bug triage and reporting, answering questions, ... However, to pass this course, your contributions will need to be meaningful and represent sufficient engineering effort.

## Course topics by week

* Week 1 (Thursday only): Introduction to course and project X
* Week 2: [Introduction to open source](modules/open-source.md) (project selection due at end of week)
* Week 3: Learning to learn (semi-)independently
* Week 4: [Tools and techniques for investigating code](modules/code-archeology.md)
* Week 5: Tools and processes for collaborating and managing projects
* Week 6: [Analytical thinking](modules/analytical-thinking.md) / [Writing bug reports](modules/bug-reports.md)
* Week 7: Creativity, defining and solving engineering problems
* Week 8: Creativity, defining and solving engineering problems
* Week 9: Technical communication, writing effective documentation
* Week 10: [Analytical thinking](modules/analytical-thinking.md) / [Debugging tools and techniques](modules/debugging.md) 
* Week 11: Code review and consensus building
* Week 12: Mentoring and being mentored
* Week 13 (Tuesday only): Office hours (no lectures)
* Week 14: 
* Week 15 (Tuesday only): Office hours (no lectures)
* Finals week: [Final presentations](final.md)

We hope that after the course students will continue working on the project and maintain the relationships they've developed.

## Generative LLM policy

Students are encouraged to make use of any generative LLM tools they find useful. However, please consider two things:

1. The use of code generation tools, needs to be consistent with the rules and culture of the open source project being contributed to. 
2. Students remain responsible for the code or other artifacts they produce. Students need to ensure it meets the quality standards of the open source project (is readable, follows style guides, is well designed, defect free, etc.).

The second point reflects the idea that expertise with such tools is not just about prompting, but verifying what is generated. Throughout the semester class time will include some practice with many tools (not just generative LLM tools) that we believe will be valuable to students.
