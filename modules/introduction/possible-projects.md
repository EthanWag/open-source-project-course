# Possible Open Source Projects 
The following is a list of possible open source projects that you might consider contributing to as part of this class.  This is by no mean an exhaustive or restrictive list.  It is just to give you ideas or a place to start looking if you don't already have a project in mind.

## Alumni Suggested Projects
The following projects were suggested by BYU CS Department Alumni that we reached out to.  All of these projects are either ones they are working with, are familiar with, or feel would be a good place for students new to open source to contribute to.

If you choose one of these projects you have a possible mentor already lined up as many of these alumni have volunteered to be mentors.  We've listed project with confirmed mentors first. If you don't already have a project in mind, we recommend considering the options in this section first.

### Confirmed Mentor Volunteer Projects
The alumni suggesting these projects have confirmed that they would be able to be a mentor this semester for students picking these projects.

#### From Ashton Wiersdorf

Projects owned by Ashton:

* [Rostrum](https://codeberg.org/ashton314/rostrum) Sacrament meeting program builder emphasizing good typography.   Elixir using the Phoenix framework.
* [Yeet](https://codeberg.org/ashton314/yeet) CLI tool to make it easy to put stuff in an S3 bucket (or whatever) on the internet and get a link to share it. (This was  mostly an exercise in vibe-coding TBH, but it turned out OK!)
* [Ysue](https://codeberg.org/ashton314/ysue) "Yoo-sway", acronym for "You Should be Using Emacs": a (very simple) text editor written in Haskell.

Other projects Ashton can help with:

* [Veloren](https://gitlab.com/veloren/veloren/) Multiplayer voxel RPG written in Rust.
* *Any Emacs package*
* [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org/) FOSS, self-hostable Git forge. [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org) is a Forgejo instance.
