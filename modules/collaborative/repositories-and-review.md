# Managing code and participating in code review

## Learning outcomes

In this module we will discuss collaboration from the perspective of source code repositories and code review. Specifically, we have the following intended learning outcomes.

1. Effectively use Git and GitHub as collaboration tools (this will involve somewhat advanced Git)
2. Contribute effectively to a code review process (and similar review processes)

## Reading

* [Google code review guide](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/) (please read all linked documents)

## Discussing

Collaboration around code changes, generally revolves around a source code repository such as Git/GitHub. The specifics of the process for contributing code varies between projects, but often involves a code review process.

Also many types of code reviews ...

Example project specific guide:

* [Ruby pull requests](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/pulls)

### Amazon leadership principles

* [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)

At Amazon there are a set of leadership principles intended to shape how people work and collaborate. I believe that many companies have similar lists of principles, but it is worth noting that at Amazon they are used heavily (during interviews and promotion cases, for example) and there is a concerted effort to maintain a culture based on those principles. Which of the following are possibly relevant to collaboration in open source projects generally, and code-review specifically?

* Customer obsession
* Ownership
* Invent and simplify
* Are right, a lot
* Learn and be curious
* Hire and develop the best
* Insist on the highest standards
* Think big
* Bias for action
* Frugality
* Earn trust
* Dive deep
* Have backbone; disagree and commit
* Deliver results
* Strive to be earth's best employer (new)
* Success and scale bring broad responsibility (new)

## Practicing

*The following is to be completed in groups of two or three students. While you are practicing, please feel free to ask questions and start impromptu class discussions. Also, please expect interruptions and be open to feedback!*

Work through the the following activities using Git and GitHub. These activities reflect a generic, but plausible workflow that considers the collaborative aspects of contributing to a project. Topics to consider:

* Cloning, branching, ...
* Options for merging (and keeping clean histories)
* Creating and iterating on code reviews

## Applying [TODO]

Complete the following tasks to develop a deeper understanding of the collaborative processes used by an open source project.

1. Find and read the relevant documentation for the project.
2. Find a recently merged contribution for the project. Review in detail how that contribution came to be accepted, by tracing it through the various parts of the process. For example, there might be a pull request with discussion, a bug report with discussion, an email/message thread, etc.
3. Repeat #2, but with an unsuccessful contribution. Say starting from a pull request that was closed without being merged.
4. Familiarize yourself with any tools used for collaboration.

## Reflecting

Submit a one page reflection on the following questions. There is no "right answer" here, but you will be graded on how insightful your answers are and the depth of understanding displayed.

* What are the key parts of the collaboration processes used in your open source project? Why are they there?
* What might differentiate a proposed contribution that is successful (i.e., accepted) from one that would not be successful?
