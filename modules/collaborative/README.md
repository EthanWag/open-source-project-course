## Reading

* [Peacemakers Needed](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2023/04/47nelson?lang=eng) by President Nelson
* [Amazon Leadership Principles](https://www.amazon.jobs/content/en/our-workplace/leadership-principles)

## Discussing

We will discuss concrete tools and processes in two submodules:

* [Collaborative tools and processes](tools-and-processes.md)
* [Engaging constructively in the code review process](code-review.md)

However, before we do we will discuss some *soft skills* and Gospel principles that can shape how you collaborate in professional settings, including open source projects.

### Soft skills

Your ability to contribute to an open source project, will be influenced by how well you connect with people in the project, and how well you understand the culture and follow the processes used by the team. Over time your ability to contribute will be enhanced as you further develop relationships and your reputation. Here are a couple additional thoughts:

* Not all processes are written down in sufficient detail. You learn by being involved. This might especially be true of the importance of **socializing a (coming) change**. This is true in open source projects and closed source projects too. By socializing a change we mean ...

* Developing a **reputation** as someone who cares about the project, makes quality contributions and will be around to maintain those contribution overtime will enhance your influence and ability to contribute. *How can you build or hurt your reputation?*

### Amazon leadership principles

At Amazon there are a set of leadership principles intended to shape how people work and collaborate. I believe that many companies have similar lists of principles, but it is worth noting that at Amazon they are used heavily (during interviews and promotion cases, for example) and there is a concerted effort to maintain a culture based on those principles. Which of the following are possibly relevant to collaboration in open source projects generally, and code-review specifically?

* Customer obsession
* Ownership
* Invent and simplify
* Are right, a lot
* Learn and be curious
* Hire and develop the best
* Insist on the highest standards
* Think big
* Bias for action
* Frugality
* Earn trust
* Dive deep
* Have backbone; disagree and commit
* Deliver results
* Strive to be earth's best employer (new)
* Success and scale bring broad responsibility (new)

### Gospel principles

Let's discuss insights from President Nelson's conference talk *Peacemakers Needed* and other gospel principles that would how you collaborate with others. Here are a few that came to my mind:

* "One of the easiest ways to identify a true follower of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people."
* "His true disciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire-â€”no matter how difficult the situation. True disciples of Jesus Christ are peacemakers."
* "How we speak to and about others at home, at church, at work, and online really matters. Today, I am asking us to interact with others in a higher, holier way. Please listen carefully. 'If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy'"
* When we humble ourselves before God and pray with all the energy of our hearts, God will grant us charity.

> "My dear brothers and sisters, the best is yet to come for those who spend their lives building up others. Today I invite you to examine your discipleship within the context of the way you treat others. I bless you to make any adjustments that may be needed so that your behavior is ennobling, respectful, and representative of a true follower of Jesus Christ."
