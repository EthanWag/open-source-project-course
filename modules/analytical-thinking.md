# Analytical Thinking in Software Engineering

Status: Nearly complete first draft (though see linked modules for their status)

## Learning outcomes

By discussing analytical thinking our aim is to:

1. Develop our understanding of the role of analytical thinking in software engineering.
2. Improve our ability to apply the principles of analytical thinking in the context of bug reporting and debugging.

## Reading

* TODO: find a nice analytical thinking overview article or chapter
* [Slack incident: Everyone back to work](https://slack.engineering/slacks-outage-on-january-4th-2021/)

## Class Discussion

Analytical thinking is the ability to break down complex information or problems into smaller, more manageable parts in order to understand them, identify patterns, draw logical conclusions, and solve problems effectively. To introduce these ideas we will discuss the Slack incident linked above, using these questions to loosely guide our discussion.

* What was the cause of the incident? Please think beyond a single root cause.
* How was it identified and mitigated? What tooling and information was used in the process?
* What aspects of analytical thinking are illustrated in this incident report?

In software engineering, analytical thinking is needed when debugging code, assessing pros and cons of a design decision, troubleshooting a system (as just discussed), and in other contexts. In this course we will discuss the following activities more specifically.

1. [Bugs, Bug Reporting and Triage](bug-reports.md)
2. [Debugging](debugging.md)
