# Learning to Learn

Notes:
* Self-directed learning
* learning curve -  where are you? where are you trying to get to? what considerations for stopping?
* How do you decide you have "learned enough?" Should you go a bit further?

## Learning outcomes

1. Understand resources, techniques, and practices for gaining new knowledge and skills
2. Learn how to develop a self-directed learning plan

## Reading

* [How to create your own self-directed learning plan](https://www.diygenius.com/how-to-create-a-self-directed-learning-plan/)
* [What is the Learning Curve? The Science of Boosting Knowledge Retention](https://maestrolearning.com/blogs/what-is-the-learning-curve-2/)
* (Optional) [Make it Stick](https://lib.byu.edu/search/byu/search?q=make%20it%20stick&scope=external) - Excellent book on how to study for retention. Link is to HBLL search results as there are lots of free online options for the book.

## Discussing

Possible discussion topics:

* When you have to learn something new, what level of detail are you focused on?  Does that level affect how you learn?
* What techniques have you used in the past to learn something new or develop a new skill?
* What hasn't worked?
* Where do you go to learn?
* Does your environment affect how you are learning?
* Where are you on the learning curve?
* How do you know if you learned enough?
* How do you retain the knowledge you've acquired? 

### Building a learning plan
1. Why are you learning this thing? - understanding "why?" provides both motivation and an ending point.  What is the target?  How will you know when you get there?
2. Set goals - The scope here can vary widely.  Maybe it is just learning how to use a function, maybe you're trying to learn a new style of programming or a new language.  
   1. For a small target, they may just be a single, small goal
   2. For larger projects you may need to break the final target down into smaller chunks.  Stepwise refinement works just as well here as it does breaking down a programming problem.  You have the skills, use them.
   3. Set deadlines and give yourself rewards for meeting them.
   4. Use the **SMART** method for setting goals on larger projects. You want goals that are **S**pecific, **M**easurable, **A**chievable, **R**elevant, and **T**imed.
3. Make a schedule
   1. Block out time to do the learning, practicing, or other activities.
   2. Know your limits - How long can you focus before you need a break?
      1. It's a mental muscle. If you push just a little past this, your "endurance" will grow over time.
   3. Schedule breaks - Get up, stretch, walk around, grab some food, step away from the work.  Our brains actually remember better the things we study right after we start and right before we stop.  Plus not focusing on a topic directly allows our sub-conscious mind to process it (This works for debugging as well).
4. Be accountable to someone - This mostly applies to larger projects.  
   1. Your intrinsic motivations comes from knowing the "why." Having someone who knows what you are working on provides additional extrinsic motivation. 
   2. They can provide encouragement when struggling and checking in with them can provide motivation to keep going. 
5. Build something.  Often trying to build/extend/fix something is what got you here in the first place.  But when trying to learn something more abstract (e.g. new framework, language, or programming paradigm) it helps to have something concrete you are working on.  This makes the learning practical instead of strictly abstract.

You probably only need to explicitly go through these steps on larger learning projects.  For smaller items, they may be intuitive or unnecessary.  But each of them apply every time, and being conscious of the steps can help.

### Tools, Techniques, & Practices
1. Official documentation - You will do a lot of reading.  Reading documentation is a skill like any other and takes practice.
2. Take lots of notes - writing things out in your own words helps fix the ideas in your mind
3. Experiment - Try out the things you are learning with different inputs and use cases to see how it reacts.  Does it do what you expected?  Do you understand why it did what it did?
4. Build something - Use the skills to make something as you are learning.  Concrete practice helps cement the ideas in your mind. (And debugging the inevitable errors helps with learning as well.)
5. Videos, How-tos, & Tutorials - Others may have gone through the same process and created guides for other to follow. Learn from trailblazers.

## Practicing

*The following is to be completed in groups of two or three students. While you are practicing, please feel free to ask questions and start impromptu class discussions. Also, please expect interruptions and be open to feedback!*

You are to build a learning plan as if you were preparing to contribute to the [Ruby programming language project](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/). The core of the language is implemented in the C programming language (C99) and building the source code involves various typical C tools. Many of the builtin libraries are implemented in Ruby. 

Develop your plan by writing down answers the the following questions (in as much detail as time permits).

1. *What is your overall learning goal (or your "why") and how will you know you've accomplished it?* This may involve reflecting on the (hypothetical) contributions you plan to make and how much you already know. For example, how well do you know the C programming language and associated tooling?
2. *How could you break down your overall leaning goal into several smaller goals?* Feel free to use a stepwise refinement process as discussed. Please try to make at least a couple of your goals SMART goals, for the stake of practice!
3. *What is a reasonable schedule for accomplishing these tasks?* Create a hypothetical schedule, including blocking off uninterrupted time for deep work.
4. *Who could you be accountable to?* Write a note to them explaining your *why* and providing details of the support you would like to get from them.
5. *What could you build that would support your learning?* This could be one thing or multiple smaller things.

Time permitting identify available resources you would use to help support your learning plan. Are there books, online tutorials, etc. that would be most helpful?

## Applying

Identify something significant you need to learn for your chosen project.  It could be a collaboration tool, a coding framework or build system, or even a new programming language.  It just needs to be something that you feel will take more than a few hours of work to accomplish.

Build yourself a learning plan to increase your expertise in that topic.  Identify the major tasks/goals you need to accomplish and plan out how you will meet them.  Schedule time to study and practice and identify how you will know when you are done. Please share your plan with your mentor and/or an other student in the course and use them as an accountability partner.

Write down your plan and start working on it.

## Reflecting

After working through your learning plan (or the first week of it if it is longer), submit your original plan along with a short reflection that addresses the following questions:

1. Why did you choose to learn this particular topic?
2. Were your goals reasonably sized or did you need to modify/refine them?
3. Was the time you blocked out reasonable? Did you feel that you could have kept going longer? Did you need to shorten the time?  What did you learn about your "study endurance" and did it change?
4. How were you accountable for your learning?
5. What did you build?
