# Curiosity and lifelong learning in software engineering

>  "A well-educated person never stops learning" [President Nelson]

## Learning outcomes

This module reflects our belief that curiosity is an important trait for a software engineering, especially (but not only) during times of disruption and rapid change. In addition to encouraging curiosity and lifelong learning generally, we have two concrete learning outcomes to pursue:

1. Develop expertise in tools and techniques for investigating and understanding an existing code base
2. Develop strategies for independently learning new programming languages, frameworks, and other technology

A little practice in this course will not make a major change for you, but we hope it will motivate you and show you the patterns you can introduce into your life that will lead to increased curiosity. We hope to help you begin to *develop the skills, confidence and desire to learn independently--including both spiritually and intellectually.*

## Discussing

### Becoming more curious?

The "You Can Train Yourself to Be More Curious" article challenges the idea we humans either have certain personality traits (like curiosity) or do not. And also the idea that our level of curiosity will likely decline as we get older. We are (the article claims) "an agentic species, capable of actively shaping who we become." The key is "deliberate practice" or a focus on "concrete behaviors rather than abstract goals"

> "Personality traits aren't mysterious internal forces completely beyond our control. They're patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving that become more automatic with repetition. Want to become more curious? Act more curious on a regular basis, and you become more curious over time."

Two key questions then are what might that deliberate practice involve for different areas of our life, and how can we sustain that practice?

### The commandment to learn

The "The Lord’s Charge to 'Seek Learning'" article 

> "Because of our sacred regard for each human intellect, we consider the obtaining of an education to be a religious responsibility. ... So my counsel ... is to continue your education wherever you are, whatever your interest and opportunity, however you determine you can best serve your family and society." [President Nelson]

What might each of us do to follow the commandment to seek learning? Here are a few ideas I came up with (inspired by the article).

* Take advantage of the institute program
* Treat sacred temples as places of instruction ("Sacred temples are also meant to instruct us in God’s ways")
* Coming to know God and Jesus Christ is the most important pursuit of our lives
* Leaning can be lifelong and "drop by drop"

## Modules

To become (and remain) a great engineer will require learning throughout your life. You should (of course) not assume that what you learn in school will be enough. We will discuss (and practice and apply) these ideas further, in a software engineering context in the following modules:

* [Learning to learn (semi-)independently](learning.md)
* [Tools and techniques for investigating code](investigating-code.md)
