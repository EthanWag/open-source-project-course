# Creativity

> "The more you trust and rely upon the Spirit, the greater your capacity to create." [Happiness, Your Heritage By President Dieter F. Uchtdorf]

## Learning outcomes

The focus of this module is creativity and problem solving, with an emphasis on solving problems in the context of project priorities and constraints. The expected learning outcomes are:

1. Apply a structured problem-solving process (Design Thinking or CPS, say) to identify problems or opportunities, and ...
2. Generate, evaluate, and select solutions based on project priorities and constraints (**divergent** and **convergent** thinking)
* *Prayerfully seek inspiration and apply creativity in solving problems professionally, personally and in service to others* 

## Reading

* [Channeling Your Creativity](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/new-era/2004/02/channeling-your-creativity?lang=eng) By Elder Robert D. Hales

## Discussing

Solving problems is an important part of software engineering and of life. We will discuss and practice problem solving in the context of creativity.

* First we will discuss a general process call the [Osborn-Parnes Creative Problem Solving Process (CPS)](cps.md)
* Second we will focus on using the process in a [software engineering context](applying-in-engineering.md) 

The proponents of processes like CPS are fundamentally arguing the creativity is a skill that can be developed and how we approach problems can affect the probability of creative breakthroughs. While we wanted to cover (at some level of detail) a comprehensive creative problem solving process, you will likely only apply some of the ideas we've discussed in an open source project during this course. Here are two final questions for discussion and personal reflection:

* What does the article by Elder Hales (see the pre-class reading list above) suggest, over and above the CPS process? What difference might his ideas make?
* As a final thought, I would like to invite you to consider what might be limiting your ability to do deep work in your life? Distractions?
