Status: Preliminary sketch

## Learning outcomes

1. Develop an understanding of the Open Source Software model and community. 
2. Understand OSS licenses and the (practical) implications of those licenses.

## Discussing

Possible discussion topics:

* History of open source
  * When did "open source software" start?
  * Why did we move away from it?
  * why did we move back?
* What advantages does open source software provide?
* What are its disadvantages?
* Types of OSS licenses, their implications, and philosophical differences.  
* Does the licence a project uses affect your willingness to contribute to the project?
* Criteria for selecting an open source project for this class
    * Your personal level of interest
    * Activity level (i.e., avoid a "dead" project)
    * Contribution opportunities that are tractable for newcomers (check for open issues, bug reports, ...)
* [Example projects to consider](possible-projects.md)

## Practicing

*The following is to be completed in groups of two or three students. While you are practicing, please feel free to ask questions and start impromptu class discussions. Also, please expect interruptions and be open to feedback!*

* Identify the licences being used by the following projects (pick ones that have a variety of different licences, i.e. GPL, MIT, BSD, Apache, etc):
  * [Mozilla Firefox](https://mozilla.org)
  * [OpenSSL](https://github.com/openssl/openssl)
  * [React web framework](https://react.dev/)
  * [git](https://git-scm.com/)
  * [The Linux Kernel](https://github.com/torvalds/linux)
* Compare and contrast the licenses from those projects.  What are the similarities? What are the differences? Do you understand the meaning of the language used in the licences? 
* Find the license being used by a project you are considering. Discuss top options each student is considering. Evaluate them based on the criteria above.

## Applying

* Identify a list of project you would like to contribute to.
* For each project:
  * Identify the license used
  * Identify ways that you could contribute (open issues, bug reports, feature requests, documentation, goals, etc.)
* Select the project you want to work on.

## Reflecting

* Submit a one-page description of the project you want to contribute to and the rationale behind your decision.  Your write-up should include:
  * The name of the project and a link to its website/Github
  * A short description of the project
  * A description of why you chose that project
  * A description of how you think you might contribute to the project
  * What OSS license the project uses and the implications that might have on your contributions.
