# Mentoring

In addition to the instructors, each student will have an alumnus (or other experienced developer) available as a mentor to support them through this course. We hope the following principles will guide the mentoring relationship.

* Students are to take the lead and the initiative. This includes coming to the mentor with questions (etc.) rather than expecting mentors to drive the interactions.   
* Mentors should avoid "taking over" from the students, but offering options and encouraging agency.
* Mentors are to maintain confidentiality, allowing students to be honest and vulnerable, without worrying their grades will be impacted.

Details of what is expected for both mentors and students can be found on the following pages:
* [Expectations for Mentors](mentors.md)
* [Expectations for Students](mentees.md)

The course is organized around the following process (from the course README):
1. Select a project
2. Learn about the technology
    * Programming languages and relevant frameworks
    * Source code (including key abstractions and design rationale) and build tools
3. Learn about the process
    * Communication tooling and culture
    * Contribution tooling and processes
4. Participate socially
    * Join discussions
    * Report and triage bugs
5. Engineering work
    * Identify possible contribution based on project goals
    * Develop and socialize the contribution
6. Contribute your work
    * Submit pull request (or similar)
    * Work through review process
7. Continue steps 2, 3, and 4 throughout the course, and repeat steps 5 and 6 as possible

As students work through each of these stages in their projects, they are bound to have questions and experience challenges.  These are opportunities for the students to work with mentors to learn about their experiences and get their insight and help on overcoming the challenges faced.  In some cases, the mentors may also be able to review the student's work and provide feedback and guidance on improvements or next steps.

## Selecting a Mentor
During the first few weeks of the semester, students should be selecting and contacting their mentor.  It is the student's responsibility to initiate this connection.  Students will coordinate the mentor selection with the instructors of the class so as not to overwhelm any one mentor with too many students.

If the student has selected a project suggested by one of our alumni (see the [Possible Projects](../modules/introduction/possible-projects.md) page) then they have a potential mentor already lined up.  Talk with the instructors to get the alumnus's contact information and reach out to them to ask them to be your mentor.

If the student has a project not suggested by one of our alumni, they should work with the professors to identify a possible mentor.  The professors have a list of alumni willing to mentor regardless of project or the student may have someone specific in mind already.  Once they have selected a possible mentor, the student should reach out to them to ask them to be your mentor.

### Reaching out to a possible mentor
Once you have a possible mentor selected, you will need to reach out to them to verify that they are willing to serve as your mentor.  In your initial contact, you should include the following information:
* Why you are reaching out to them
  * Tell them about the class and your need for a mentor
  * Tell them about the project you are working on
  * Explain why you selected them as a potential mentor
* A little about yourself - just a few sentences here, they don't need a full bio. You'll have time to get to know each other better once the mentoring starts.
* Ask them if they would be willing to work with you as your mentor.
  * Include a date when you need to have an answer but give them at least a week to respond.
* If they are not one of our pre-prepared alumni, you should share this page (and the expectations pages) with them so they know what the arrangement involves. We've already shared it with the alumni volunteers on our list.

## Working with Your Mentor
Once you've found someone to server as your mentor, take advantage of it. Try to meet weekly, come with questions, ask for their help, listen to their advice and suggestions, report on successes and challenges, and develop a lasting relationship. 

## Reporting on the Mentoring Experience
At the end of the semester, the student will write a reflection on their mentoring relationship, and we will be soliciting feedback from the mentors on what worked and what didn't.  The mentor feedback will in no way affect the student's course grade but rather is designed to help us improve the process and instruction for future semesters.
