# Mentoring

Each student will have available an alumnus as an mentor to support them through this course. We hope the following principles will guide the mentoring relationship.

* Students are to take the lead and the initiative. This includes coming to the mentor with questions (etc.) rather than expect mentors to 
* Mentors should avoid "taking over" from the students, but offering options and encouraging agency.
* Mentors are to maintain confidentiality, allowing students to be honest and vulnerable, without worrying their grades will be impacted.

## Expectation for mentors

* Be available for 30 minutes per week, as needed.
* Be familiar with the course schedule to provide relevant support.

## Expectation for students

* Schedule a regular time to meet with your mentor
* Prepare for each meeting, to ensure you make good use of his/her time
