# Expectation for students
As part of this class (and as a mentee) we expect the following commitments and qualities from you in your mentor/mentee relationship.  These qualities also apply to your interactions with other students and your professors.

As you work with your mentor, you should strive to create a personal relationship with them and not just make it a transactional requirement you are doing for the class. This relationship is something that can last well beyond the class and into your professional career.  Our goal in the class is to help you learn and practice how to develop a good mentor/mentee relationship so that you build many such relationships throughout your life.

## Commitment

* Schedule a regular time, preferably weekly, to meet with your mentor for up to 30 minutes.
* Be prepared for each meeting, to ensure you make good use of his/her time.
* Take the effort seriously and use this time to learn and grow.

## Qualities

* Respect your mentor's time
    * Take the initiative and come prepared to each meeting. You should be driving the majority of the discussion.
    * Be organized and efficient.  You typically only have about 30 minutes, use them wisely.
    * Be willing to be flexible based on your mentors schedule and commitments.
* Be willing to learn
    * Be curious and ask questions to learn, gain clarity, and be able to make informed decisions.  As mentees, your mentor expects you to have questions, and they want to answer them (or help you find the answers).
    * Be open to receiving, understanding, and evaluating feedback, both positive and negative.
* Demonstrate accountability and follow-through
    * Share your goals and expectations with your mentor and update them on progress, challenges, and setbacks.
    * Act on the advice given by your mentor. Report on actions they ask or recommend you take.
* Be open in your discussions
    * Nothing you discuss with your mentor will be reported back to the instructors.
    * Be honest about your challenges; they can't help if you don't tell them.
