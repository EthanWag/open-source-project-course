SUBJECT: Help Shape a New Open Source Course for CS Students

Dear CS alum,

This fall the computer science department is introducing a new course that will allow students to contribute to an open source project of their choosing. The goal of the course is to help students improve their resumes, establish professional connections, and develop important software engineering skills. 

In preparation for this course we are seeking alumni who are involved in open source projects who would be willing to support our efforts. We would welcome help with course development, student mentoring, visiting lectures, open source project suggestions, and more.

If you’re interested in contributing—whether in a small or large way—or if you’d simply like more information, please contact Jonathan Sillito (sillito@cs.byu.edu) or Tom Stephens (tstephen@cs.byu.edu).

Thank you!
